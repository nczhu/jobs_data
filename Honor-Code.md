Growth Mindset Honor Code


Growth Mindset is about developing skills through dedication and hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. Our mission is to encourage and amplify your efforts to achieve great things, by providing the following environment:

We’re a learning community that caters to all skill levels. It’s important we maintain this encouraging and positive culture. No smarty-pants needed. We want open-minded individuals who are kind to one another.




1. Open Source
We openly share materials and insights we create along our learning journeys so that others can benefit.




1. Smartly Committed
We believe in the 10k hours to become truly good at something. We’re committed to the learning and being substantial. We also want to do this efficiently, so not just one path for everyone. 




1. Community First
